### Summary
The goal for this analysis was to identify regions of interest within the United States that would benefit from Change Unlimited's fundraising platform, helping focus business resources on enhancing social impact. 

Non-profitorganizations spend an excessive amount of resources harvesting busienss relationships, many times at the expense  of driving real impact. One can make the argument that raising funds allows for increased impact, and although true, a platform that has reach and scale for donors and fundraisers  allows for both, increased revenues and increased impact. 

This is **Change Unlimited's** objective. 

#### Analysis: Are revenues for non-profit organizations impacted by household income?\


**TL;DR**

### Background & Inspiration

With a background in finance and wealth management, I always carry a deep personal interest in understanding how money impacts decision making across busnesses and individuals. Money/Finance is one of the few instruments in life which is found in practically every interaction. We have practically tied it directly into time. 

Constinently carrying this view, I look for ways to apply different analysis in areas that I don't fully understand. Shortly after moving to Austin, TX I met Change Unlimited's Founder. As a default skeptic of non-profit organizations, he allowed me to look into some of the startups information

- **how to remove any bias since, donations can be done outside of region?**
- Establish $H_0$ & $H_a$
- .....
