##### TL;DR

**H<sub>0</sub>:** mean of NPs’ revenue ***are the same*** in lower & upper-half of mean household income. <br>
**H<sub>A</sub>:** mean of NPs’ revenue ***are NOT the same*** in lower & upper-half of mean household income.

### Summary
___
The goal for this analysis was to identify regions of interest within the United States that would benefit from Change Unlimited's fundraising platform, helping focus business resources on enhancing social impact. 

Non-profit organizations spend an excessive amount of resources harvesting busienss relationships, many times at the expense  of driving real impact. One can make the argument that raising funds allows for increased impact, and although true, a platform that has reach and scale for donors and fundraisers  allows for both, increased revenues and increased impact. 

This is **Change Unlimited's** objective. 

### Background & Inspiration
___

With a background in finance and wealth management, I always carry a deep personal interest in understanding how money impacts decision making across busnesses and individuals. Money/Finance is one of the few instruments in life which is found in every human interaction, practically tied into time. 

Constinently carrying this view, I look for ways to apply different analysis in areas that I don't fully understand. Shortly after moving to Austin, TX I met Change Unlimited's Founder, a startup looking to change the way non-profit organizations fundraise. As a default skeptic of non-profit organizations, I had many questions. 

My skepticism stems mainly from the mismanagement of funds and the difficulty to measure the true social impact an organization makes. Having these doubts, Change Unlimited kindly allowed me to analyze the organzations data and help develop ideas on possible paths forward.

#### Analysis: Are revenues for non-profit organizations impacted by household income?

## Hypothesis
The first question I wanted to answer was very high level. Having little domain knowdlege of the non-profit industry, I started at a point that is most familiar, money/finance. Hoping I would uncover more questions than answers, it definitely didn't disappoint. 

**H<sub>0</sub>:** mean of NPs’ revenue ***are the same*** in lower & upper-half of mean household income. <br>
**H<sub>A</sub>:** mean of NPs’ revenue ***are NOT the same*** in lower & upper-half of mean household income.

The t-test was conducted on revenues between the NPs operating in areas below the mean household income and those above the mean household income. Considering this was an initial dive, not having many biases going into this project, and understand the realities of distribution of income, I initially set my alpha at .10. This increased my chances of observing Type I errors.

## Data

-----------
- Scrape data from websites
- Review number of non-profits by region
- Identify demographics by region (income, age, household, etc..)
- **how to remove any bias since, donations can be done outside of region?**
- Establish $H_0$ & $H_a$
- .....
