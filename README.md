### Summary
The goal for this analysis was to identify regions of interest within the United States that would benefit from Change Unlimited's fundraising platform, helping focus business resources on enhancing social impact. 

Non-profitorganizations spend an excessive amount of resources harvesting busienss relationships, many times at the expense  of driving real impact. One can make the argument that raising funds allows for increased impact, and although true, a platform that has reach and scale for donors and fundraisers  allows for both, increased revenues and increased impact. 

This is **Change Unlimited's** objective. 


### Analysis: Are non-profit revenues impacted by household income? 
Does level of income/demographic translate to higher non-profit revenues by regions?

# Strategy
-----------
- Scrape data from websites
- Review number of non-profits by region
- Identify demographics by region (income, age, household, etc..)
- **how to remove any bias since, donations can be done outside of region?**
- Establish $H_0$ & $H_a$
- .....
